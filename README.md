# ASUMap

Summary: : ASUMap is am Unity game/app intended to help the user navigate through the ASU campus. This all has the same perspective as the popular Pokémon Go and like it, lets the user navigate through the world to locate various ASU buildings. I created this because there was no other product like it at the moment. 
To create ASUMap, I hade to write various GPS tracking scripts and movement scripts. I could have used a Google plugin to do this, but I felt the was too easy of a solution that I would not learn much from. I instead wrote my own GPS scrips that would use the phone’s navigation system to determine the user location. I also had to create a model of every ASU building, 88 in total. 
While the app is not yet complete, the core funtinality is. 

Master file should only contain finished product. 
Please wait for ASU 3D Map Version 1.0 @ December 10, 2016.
