# ASUMap

This is a Capstone project that I and several other students are making for our ASU class. These models and games have no professional use and are not made for profit. We are using student versions of all the programs we have. 
If you would like to use any of the code, models, or documents in here for any professional use, please send a busisness inquery to the following email. All other questions can be sent to the same email as well.
